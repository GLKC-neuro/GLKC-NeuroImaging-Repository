# GLKC-NeuroImaging-Repository

GLKC NeuroImaging by Gabriella Blissett (PhD Student, Newcastle Australia).
This repository contains materials researchers may find useful when choosing or training a method to analyse CNS cells, including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and/or neurons. 

I am currently in the process of consolidating my methods for CNS cell segmentation/measurement, so WATCH THIS SPACE!

However, if you do have  questions, I a more than happy to point you in the right diection of Open Source methods currently avaliable:
